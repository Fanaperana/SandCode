### Introduction

SandCode is a Tauri app built with Vue that allows developers to save code snippets locally on their computer. It is similar to GitHub Gist, but it is a standalone application that does not require an Internet connection. SandCode is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with features such as syntax highlighting and search functionality.
